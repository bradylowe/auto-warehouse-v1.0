## *Dependencies:*
 - Unity3D (not sure how new your version needs to be, but maybe 2017.1 and up)
 - Unity's NavMesh plugin (if you don't already have it by default)
 - (in the future) Unity's ML Agents plugin (not yet working on my setup)

## *How to use:*
 - Clone the project to your computer.
 - If you have Linux, you can download and run one of the executables built with these assets. 
 - Read the documentation and look at any videos I have made available on the Assets in the Assets folder.
 - Figure out which assets you are looking for (materials, forklift prefabs, control scripts, etc.)
 - Grab the assets that you think will best suit your needs and import it into your project's assets (drag and drop).
 - Try it out. If it isn't quite what you need, you can tweak some setting, write some code, or try another asset.

## *Assets available:*
 - Forklift assets such as full forklift prefabs, prefabs of just the forks, controller scripts, and materials as well as score controller scripts, UI text prefabs and controllers, and a camera controller script for following a forklift.
 - Pallet assets such as pallet prefabs, destination box prefabs, controller scripts, and materials.
 - Shelving assets such as shelf prefabs and pole prefabs (for building detailed shelves).
 - Scenes are not yet available but will be soon.
